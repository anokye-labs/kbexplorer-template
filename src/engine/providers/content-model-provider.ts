/**
 * ContentModelProvider (F2 / T2.2 + T2.4 — issues #161, #163).
 *
 * Wraps the schema-driven {@link buildContentModel} pipeline as a
 * {@link GraphProvider}. Relationships are emitted as `connections` on the source
 * nodes (the orchestrator ignores a provider's `edges` and `buildGraph` derives
 * edges from `connections`), so the resolved edges render in the graph.
 *
 * **Safe no-op when no content-model source is present** — it returns no nodes,
 * so existing graphs (this repo has no content-model source) are unchanged.
